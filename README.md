Work Day Scheduler

For this assignment, We were tasked with adding functionality to this dynamic time updated planner website. 

### Prerequisites

In order to use the planner, you'll need a device with internet connection, and a browser.

## Getting Started

I've included a screenshot of what the site looks like. The site is also linked below so feel free to take a look! 
Please note the different aspects of the dynamically updating time-based interface, such as:
- Date and day of week listed on header
- Any text input into one of the input fields remains after page reload
